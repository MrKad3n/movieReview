 <h1>Details and Summary for The Silent God</h1>
 <p>In a dying world where gods have turned their faces from humankind, a young priestess named Elara serves in the ruins of a forgotten temple, clinging to faith in a deity who has not spoken for a thousand years. The land is blighted—crops rot in the fields, monsters stalk the mist, and the kingdoms wage endless wars in the absence of divine guidance.

When a wounded stranger named Kael arrives at the temple, claiming to hear whispers from the silent god, Elara&apos;s faith is shaken. Desperate to understand whether Kael is a prophet, a liar, or something far darker, she embarks with him on a perilous journey across a realm collapsing into shadow.

As they traverse desolate cities and haunted forests, Elara uncovers fragments of a forgotten truth—that the god she worships may have chosen silence not from abandonment, but from guilt. The boundary between mortal and divine begins to crumble, and Elara must decide whether to awaken a god who once destroyed the world… or let silence reign forever.</p>
