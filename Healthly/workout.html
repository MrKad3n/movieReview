    <h2>Practical Tips for Daily Nutrition</h2>
    <p>Building healthy habits doesn't have to be overwhelming. Start with these simple, actionable steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Add, Don't Just Subtract:</strong> Focus on adding one more vegetable or fruit to your meals instead of only thinking about what to cut out.</li>
        <li><strong>Read Labels:</strong> Get to know what's in your food. Pay attention to sugar, sodium, and ingredients you can't pronounce.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook at Home:</strong> Even a few meals a week gives you complete control over ingredients, portion sizes, and cooking methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Eat when you're hungry and stop when you're satisfied. Your body has smart signals—learn to trust them.</li>
        <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> A little bit of meal planning can save you from making less-healthy "in-a-pinch" decisions during a busy week.</li>
